## Files That Make It Work

### Core Files
- `src/lib/paypal.js` - Backend PayPal service with retry logic
- `src/app/api/paypal/route.js` - API endpoint with error handling
- `src/components/payments/AddPayPalMethodModal.jsx` - Frontend modal
- `src/components/payments/PayPalPaymentForm.jsx` - Payment form
- `src/providers/PayPalProvider.jsx` - PayPal SDK wrapper

### Configuration
- `.env.local` - PayPal credentials (CLIENT_ID, SECRET)

## Credentials in Use

```
Mode: Sandbox (testing)
Client ID: AXStFuY7MPA4... (valid ✅)
Secret: EDaokRWMKc2h... (valid ✅)
API: https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com
```

## Network Resilience

Your integration now handles:
- ✅ Slow internet connections
- ✅ Temporary network interruptions
- ✅ DNS resolution failures
- ✅ Packet loss (tested with 25% loss)
- ✅ API timeouts

All of this happens **automatically** - users just see "Please wait..." while retries happen in the background.

## Monitoring

### Watch Server Logs
Open your terminal and watch for:

**Success:**
```
🔄 Attempt 1/3 for https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/...
✅ PayPal Auth Success
✅ Vault setup created
```

**Retry in Action:**
```
🔄 Attempt 1/3 for https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/...
❌ Attempt 1 failed: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN
⏳ Waiting 1000ms before retry...
🔄 Attempt 2/3 for https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/...
✅ PayPal Auth Success
```

## Need to Test?

### Quick Connection Test
```bash
node test-paypal-with-retry.js
```

Should output:
```
✅ SUCCESS! PayPal credentials are valid!
🎉 Your PayPal integration is ready to use!
```

### Restart Dev Server (if needed)
```bash
npm run dev
```

## PayPal Sandbox Test Accounts

You'll need PayPal sandbox accounts to test:

1. **Merchant Account**: Already configured (your credentials)
2. **Buyer Account**: Create at https://developer.paypal.com
   - Login to PayPal Developer Dashboard
   - Go to "Sandbox" → "Accounts"
   - Create a "Personal" account
   - Use this to test payments

## Common Actions
